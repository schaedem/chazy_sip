## Research objectives
- Determine the impact of a 42 year legacy of no-till or moldboard plow tillage on bacterial carbon assimilation
- Investigate the role of divergent life histories resulting from management legacy in contributing to carbon dynamics

## Methodology
- Microcosm experiments involved two carbon isotopic labeling treatments and two soil legacies:
  - 12C-xylose + 13C-cellulose / 13C-xylose + 12C-cellulose
  - No-till biomass harvested (NTH) / plow-till biomass harvested (PTH)
- Isopycnic centrifugation and density fractionation was performed on genomic DNA extracted from microcosm soil samples
- Amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA was conducted, followed by multiple-window-high-resolution-stable-isotope-probing (MW-HR-SIP) to identify isotopically labeled taxa

## Availability of sequence data
16S rRNA sequence data are available in the NCBI Short Read Archives (BioProject PRJNA1170979).
